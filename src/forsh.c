  forsh is intended to be run via ForceCommand directive in sshd_config. It will not run if only forwarding (-W or ProxyJump) is
  requested. So, if it IS run, it means either interactive login or remote command execution is requested.

  If remote command execution is requested, sshd will set SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND variable and then will run what is defined via
  ForceCommand (or shell, passing original command via -c switch). Hence, to distinguish between interactive login and remote
  command execution we check for SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND variable.
